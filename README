Unix v6
=======

This is the reimplementation in ANSI C of Unix v6.

Features
--------

* **Refactored build system**: the separation between distribution and kernel is now clear. The complete distribution, (SUS-1 compliant) is available in distrib/. The rest of the kernel uses recursive makefiles.
* **vfs**: the filesystem layer is now abstract. Multiple filesystem support is now possible. Currently FAT32 and ext2 are in progress.
* **ACPI support**: a limited set of ACPI commands are supported. Currently mainly shutdown/S5 mode.
* **userland libc**: C89/ANSI compliant + POSIX-1 compliant
* **SUS-1 compliance**: As for kernel support, users and signals are still missing for POSIX-1 support, while some syscalls are already present. On the userland part, the libc and FHS are in progress. Update: libc almost finished.
