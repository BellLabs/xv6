Unix v6
=======

This is the reimplementation in ANSI C of Unix v6.

Features
--------

* **Refactored build system**: the separation between userland and kernel is now clear. The complete userland distribution, along with its mkfs and coreutils is available in distrib/. The rest of the kernel uses recursive makefiles.
* **vfs**: the filesystem layer is now abstract. Multiple filesystem support is now possible. Currently FAT32 and ext2 are in progress.
* **ACPI support**: a limited set of ACPI commands are supported. Currently mainly shutdown/S5 mode.
* **userland libc**: a simple and still in progress userland POSIX libc.
* **POSIX compliance**: As for kernel support, users and signals are still missing, while some syscalls are already present. On the userland part, the libc and FHS are in progress.
